	<p> 

Excuse me miss. 
Did you not see me standing by? 
Did you not hear my diatribe get twisted by a dying tribe? 
Did you not notice when I cried, 
or, hat in hand, apologized, 
or made a show of how I tried, and tried, and tried? 
For I am just a passerby, a fool whose pastimes passed him by,
and now, it seems, weâ€™re past our time, 
So may I be excused?

The Grand Performance explores the journey of an activist, including feelings of internal conflict and self-doubt. The first Scene presents a poem and digital collage. The subsequent Scenes feature a single verse from the poem, along with imagery generated by feeding that verse into an AI image generator. The full collage was created by sampling from the dozens of images generated during this process.
